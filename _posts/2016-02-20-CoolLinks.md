**Hola Kids!**

It's time for another cool link roundup. So, here's some stuff I found online that was cool.

[New Cancer Treatment - 90% Success rate!](http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/treatment-saved-90-of-terminal-cancer-patients-but-it-has-scary-side-effects/) : *Via www.arstechnica.com*

I've kept a pretty close eye on promising cancer treatments over the last 15 or so years. This one looks promising. The basic premise is that scientists are modifying cancer patients own immune system to fight cancer. If they can iron out the kinks, this would be immensely good news for a lot of people.


[Mount Rushmore 2.0](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3056811/exposure/the-failed-plan-to-give-every-president-their-own-mount-rushmore-head/10) : *Via www.fastcodesign.com*

Somewhere, out in the middle of nowhere, is a sea of Presidents heads. Rotting away in the elements.

**APPLE VS FBI**

Things are starting to come to a head in this extremely important debate. It feels, to me at least, that if this isn't a line in the sand for us as a society, than its pretty damn close to it. I'm not going to write too much about this here, but I will list off some of the better articles on it I've read this week.

[A clear statement of intention from Tim Cook.](http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/) : *Via www.apple.com*

[A nice summary of why this should matter to you, regardless of what phone or device you have.](http://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-care-about-apple-s-fight-with-the-fbi-1759639200) : *Via Gizmodo.com*

[A little sidenote on how this helps Apple position itself in the market.](http://www.wired.com/2016/02/apples-noble-stand-against-the-fbi-is-also-great-business/) : *Via wired.com*

[Finally, someone from Alphabet (Formerly Google) steps in and says something on this issue. It's not very strongly worded, but its far better than silence on the subject.](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11040266/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-sides-with-apple-encryption) : *Via Verge.com*

[And then things take a weird turnâ€¦](http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-terrorists-appleid-passcode-changed-in-government-cust#.slK6XGlmx) : *Via Buzzfeed.com*

I would talk about Gravitational Waves, but I think they've gotten enough coverage over the last 100 or so years. Big day for physics though!

Have a great week everybody!

**2016-02-22 UPDATE:** [Apple](www.apple.com) has posted a FAQ on whats happening [here](http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/answers/). Also, Tim Cook sent an email memo to all Apple employees regarding what's happening, which you can read on theverge.com [here](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/22/11092028/apple-tim-cook-fbi-encryption-internal-memo).
