While there is a whole list of different ways you can emulate old OS's and software on current hardware, (...and ways to acquire old hardware for gobs and gobs of time and money...) this has got to be one of the easiest ways to go back to a simpler time. **A time where grayscale printers were a luxury, and a one button mouse was all you'd ever need.**

And it's all thanks to the fine folks at [Internet Archive][3142c7b8]

I used to have [SheepShaver][0b5a43f5] installed just so I could run old copies of software that aren't supported anymore, but I no longer need any of those titles. If I get nostalgic, Mac OS 7 is now just a click away!
