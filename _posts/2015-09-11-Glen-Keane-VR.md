Have you ever seen a Disney animated feature? If you watched one made in the last 30 years, chances are that [Glen Keane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Keane) had a hand in it. He's a legend in the animation field. He's started out in the traditional 2D animation studios at Disney, but has pursued computer animation as well.

Just look at how his hands move while he draws! **LOOK AT THEM**. That is a master artist.

Hope you enjoy watching it as much as I did!
