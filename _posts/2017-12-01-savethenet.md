**It's that time again...**

I know there's a lot going on in this crazy world right now. But I can't stress enough how important it is right now to have the internet be open and accessible to all. It's become a standard utility for people to communicate and distribute information.

We're being asked to trust the ISP's to regulate themselves, despite the fact that they've done a terrible job of that in the past.

December 14th is rapidly approaching. Call your representatives. [File with the FCC.](http://gofccyourself.com/) Tweet. Do whatever you can to make your voice heard.
