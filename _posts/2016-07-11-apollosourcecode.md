I saw this over at [512pixels.com](http://512pixels.net/2016/07/apollo-11-github/), which is a favorite of mine. Just had to share.

So, apparently NASA released the source code for the Guidance Computer Software used on the Apollo missions. It didn't take long for some good humored programmers to make an [issue of that one little-itty-bitty issue Apollo 13 had.](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11/issues/3) You may remember it best as that [Tom Hanks movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/).

Some classic IT jokes pop up, as well as some screenshots of the issue. "Try turning it off, then back on again..."
