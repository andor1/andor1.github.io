Hey kiddos, it's been too long since I last posted something. So here's a bunch of cool stuff I noticed on the internet over the last week... or couple weeks... or month... Does it really matter?

[2 Kinds of People](http://2kindsofpeople.tumblr.com/) - This Tumblr site is the creation of illustrator JoÃ£o Rocha, and I find it endlessly funny. He has a very simple graphic style, and each comparison is bitingly accurate.

[Lance Wyman's Minnesota Zoo Designs](http://www.itsnicethat.com/features/lance-wyman-unit-editions) - I have many fond memories of going to the [Minnesota Zoo](http://mnzoo.org) as a kid, even though the [Como Zoo](http://www.comozooconservatory.org) will always be my favorite. But Time Magazine says that this is one of best designs in the USA of 1981. You know, the year Pope John Paul II was [shot](http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/may13th.html)?

[Tesla's new vehicle has a bioweapon defence button...](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/30/9421719/tesla-model-x-bioweapon-defense-mode-button) - This is posted without comment... Except for "Whaaaa....?"

[An auto-complete tool for Animation... by Microsoft?](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3052463/microsoft-research-debuts-autocomplete-for-animation-and-its-incredible) - 10 Years ago, I would have not thought this were possible. Even now, I have a hard time believing it.

That wraps it up for now kids. Have a great week and we'll see you again soon!
