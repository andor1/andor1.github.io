Well, lets just take a look at what's going on in the world...

**THE APPLE VS FBI CASE**

Boy, this thing just keeps getting bigger and more aggressive.

Both sides are working hard to frame themselves as the good guy in the court of public opinion, but things are turning ugly fast as people start realizing just how much this one little case could change their personal security in the long run.

Still, things could be worse. At least no one is proposing using nukes to power spacecraft or anything...

**THE RUSSIAN PLAN TO USE NUKES TO SEND A SHIP TO MARS**

Gah! Nuke powered space ships? Does anyone else get that whole "Cold War never really went away" vibe from this? I need a drink.

**IMPENDING SHORTAGE OF FINE AGED SINGLE MALT SCOTCH**

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

[Scotch Shortage - Via CNN.com](http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/04/luxury/global-single-malt-scotch-whisky-drought/index.html)

The major take away point on this article? Even if these distillery's increase their output now, the product still takes 10-12 years to properly age in the casks. Legally it has to age three years at least, but that's not nearly enough time for it to smooth and mellow the flavor. Some companies are releasing bottles without the years aged on the label, which seems... less than honest.

Prices on good bottles of Scotch are rising, and there's no end in sight for how high they could go. If I had money to invest, now would be a good time to buy some stock in the parent companies of Black Bowmore, Macallan, Laphroaig, Oban... etc...

Sounds like the good stuff will be most expensive once my kids start hitting their teenage years. So, yay.
