**That's not exactly what I intended...**

So, in my last [post][going-back] I talked about wanting more time with my daughter before going back to work. Next Wednesday was going to be a terrible day for me, and it was going to be the best thing for us all, and blah blah blah.

Then I got laid off.

*POOF! Wish granted!*

**I could be angry**

Yeah, I probably should be angry. They didn't handle it very well. It was awkward and unprofessional. But it's not like I didn't see it coming. My wife commented that I predicted that they would do this when we had first started dating. *That was four years ago.* And it's not as though other co-workers past and present hadn't advised me to start looking elsewhere. They did. Multiple times.

There's no need for me to go into my diatribe on "assets" and de-humanization for the almighty bottom-line here. It's nothing you don't already know. (Though if you really want to see me get angry and worked up, give me a barstool and some whiskey and mention the term "corporate greed" in passing.)

Staying with the company this long was a calculated risk, it's just that the timing was a bit off. This is just motivation to accelerate the next stage of the plan, now featuring 100% less safety net.

No, I'm not angry. I was for the first hour. Thats enough wasted energy. I have other priorities now.

**Priorities**

I think it's a pretty common reaction to immediately hit up Craigslist and start searching. Then look over your resume. Then open up a fine bottle of scotch. Then your wife opens your eyes to how obsessive you're being. (Your experience may vary. My wife is awesome *and* smart. And I've got some fine scotch here. You'll have to parse your own data.)

So, for the next few days, I've been advised not to think about jobs and searching for jobs too much (...with one exception.) I'm going to take it easy, regroup, and go on the offensive on Monday. In the meantime, I'm going to play with my kids, work on some comics to post, play some guitar, cook... basically all the things I enjoy doing.

After that, any advice, help with resumes, hints about possible openings, all that will be readily accepted and appreciated.

Right now, I hear my kids downstairs laughing. My new job is to keep them laughing.

**Up next week: The job search and my thoughts on the ideal job. PLUS COMICS!**

**Thanks for the well-wishing and support!**
