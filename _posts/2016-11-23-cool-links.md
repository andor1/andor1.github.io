**About this comic**

No matter what side of the fence you were on in this Election Cycle, I hope you have a wonderful holiday, and I wish you the best for the future.

**DESIGN STUFF**

Here's a clever website for a print shop! It's actually a printed document, that's been made interactive for the web, that you can order IN PRINTED FORM. Nice work gentlemen!

- [Somerset - www.printedbysomerset.com](1)

**MAC HISTORY**

Remember [CompUSA](4)? The Computer Superstore? Odd side note: I worked at one, and spent most of my time in the Apple section.

- [Apple store-within-a-store at CompUSA](3)

Now go enjoy time with your family!
