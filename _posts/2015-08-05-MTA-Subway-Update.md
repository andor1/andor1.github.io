I saw this on [Laughing Squid ](http://laughingsquid.com/the-mta-explains-their-antiquated-subway-control-system-and-the-ongoing-upgrade-to-communications-based-train-control/) today. It's endlessly facisinating to me how this system runs. Look at that control panel! The hand-wired switches!

I unerstand why they're upgrading everything, but man that stuff is cool. That control room is filled with technology spanning several decades, and all I want to do is run up and pull those levers on the wall while screaming "It's ALIVE!" in my best Dr. Frankenstein.

I love trains, and mass transit systems like this always seemed like the hallmark of a progressive, world-class city. Here in the Twin Cities, we finally have the backbone of a [light-rail system](http://www.metrotransit.org/metro-system) , but it's all new and lacks the history and character of NYC's system.

I sure hope this equipment finds its way into a museum.

Toodles!
