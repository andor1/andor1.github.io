So, without warning, [Wilco dropped a new album on us.](http://wilcoworld.net/new-album-star-wars-available-now/)

It's free to download, or if you want to get the CD or Vinyl you can order that too.  

I've only had time to listen through it once so far, so I'll have to listen to it a couple more times before I write up a review. But at least for right now, I can tell you it's very layered in guitars, and it's very energetic.

So, happy Friday Wilco fans!
