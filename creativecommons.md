**So, here's the deal...**

Everything on my site (unless otherwise noted) is under a [Creative Commons License.](https://creativecommons.org)

If you want to post some of my work on your website, or social media, print it out, whatever... that's cool. Just attribute the work to me or my site.

If you want to remix some of my work for a personal project, or whatever, that's cool too. But you need to use a comparable license. Share and share alike! Let me know what cool stuff you come up with!

If you want to use my stuff for a commercial application, [you should talk to me first.](mailto:andor@mac.com)

Thanks,

*Doran*
