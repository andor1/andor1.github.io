**Adobe Illustrator turns 30 years old**

[From Boing Boing](adobe)

I've been using Adobe Illustrator since 1999. It is *by far* my favorite graphics tool. (Illustrator 7 is still my favorite version.) The history behind it is still pretty cool, maybe even more so than Photoshop. To me at least.

Here's to another 30 years!
