# The Road

Imagine that you're driving. Imagine that you're in your car, just trying to get to work or get to the store.

That's pretty basic. A majority of us do that every day.

Now, imagine that every single road or street you travel to get to your destination were a toll road. 

There's a really big battle for the internet happening right now. I'm sure you're aware.

I want to spend a little time on some of the finer points of what's happening on internet policy, as I see it.
