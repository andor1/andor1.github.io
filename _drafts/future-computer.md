**Pipe Dreams**

When I was a kid, people kept telling me that computers were the future and that in order to get a good job, I had to learn how to use one. But for me, they looked like big ugly boxes. They didn't look like the ones I saw in the movies. I liked what you could do with them, which as a kid was play games. You could *draw*, but it wasn't really *drawing*. You could record some sound or video, but it was really grainy and awful sounding / looking.

The computers I liked had wall-sized displays, and could talk back to you. You didn't have to type. You just thought out loud and the computer did the work for you. I wanted [The Jetsons](1) and [HAL 9000](2) and unfortunately, it was the 1980's.

**Baby Steps**

By the time I was old enough to start really wanting all of this stuff, some smart people had already figured out how to do a lot of it. It just wasn't technologically viable yet. For some good reading, check out [MIT's DATALAND](3) and [Xerox's PARC projects](4)
