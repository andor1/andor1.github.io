# Intro

When I was little, I loved space. Space exploration, space stations, rockets, the whole bit. I used to borrow books from the library about how rockets were made, and look at photos of the moon landings, and all those books and magazine articles about how we were going to colonize Mars and have a moon base, etc etc... I thought for sure it was going to happen next year. Or the next. Or the year after that. I'm sure a lot of people did.

But, like flying cars, jetpacks, and home nuclear reactors, none of the technology was ready yet.

If you've been paying attention lately, [SpaceX](1) has now repeatedly landed a reusable rocket booster successfully on an autonomous barge in the ocean, after it delivered its cargo to the [ISS](2). Let me re-phrase that. *They just sent a robotic rocket into space, dropped off some stuff, then came back to Earth and landed on a boat that is also a robot.* That is one of the most amazing, crazy things that's ever happened.

# Dollar Signs

While we are still hamstrung by overcoming some basic physics, the other major hurdle in front of us getting to space has always been cost. The amount of money needed to get one person into orbit is a huge hinderance, and every space program in existence has had to make every dollar count. Program budgets have been slashed or cancelled outright.

There's reasons for it, of course. We're not really in a space race anymore. We're not competing against a rival ideology like we were during the [Cold War](3).
