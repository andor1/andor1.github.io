"System status please..."

*All systems are nominal. No issues to report.*

"God... how many days uptime is that?"

His eyes darted around the room.

*180 days, 7 hours, 48 minutes.*

"That long already..."

*You have asked me everyday since this contract began. You seem very anxious. Your reassignment is bothering you?*

# Second Draft

"How much longer?"

*Approximately 2 hours.*

"...."

He moves his hands off the console and down into his lap. The chair creaks as he leans back.

*I can tell you are distressed. We have worked together now for nearly one full year.*

"I know."

*Perhaps it will help for you to talk about what you are feeling? Systems are nominal at the moment, so you have my full attention.*

"You're not programmed for this."

*I am not. However, we have worked closely for some time. I have some insight into your personality and background. I may be able to help, and I can certainly listen.*
