## Opening

I spent the better part of the last couple weeks trying to fix a very old gas dryer in our basement. Our best guess is that it was built in the 60's. Long story short, while I *could* repair it, parts were not readily available due to it's age, and I didn't have the time to spend locating those parts.

I hated putting that dryer on the curb. I'd rather fix the things I own and keep them running as long as possible. It's not just economical, it's good for the environment. Plus, if the kids are around to help, they pick up new skills.

## The Detractors

Just read this article. [This is incredibly bad.][05a4bd0b]

  [05a4bd0b]: http://boingboing.net/2017/04/22/drm-eschatology.html "John Deere just told the copyright office that only corporations can own property, humans can only license it"


[This][05a4bd0b] is something entirely different. Effectively, the company is telling you that you do not own their product. You don't have rights to it. You've "licensed" the software that the tractor runs on. Farmers have always been do-it-yourself people, out of sheer necessity. As the corporate farms close in on them on all sides, now they're being told they don't own their equipment.

## The Big Payback

Then there's this: [The new iMac has user replaceable RAM and Harddirves!][c2eb1b47]

  [c2eb1b47]: https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iMac+Intel+21.5-Inch+Retina+4K+Display+2017+Teardown/92170 "ifixit: iMac Intel 21.5" Retina 4K Display 2017 Teardown"

This might be a sign that someone upstairs at these companies is listening, at least a little bit.
