My dad built me a little work bench when I was about 5. I had a little box with some kid sized hand-tools. It was just to the left of his workbench, so I could pretend to be building the same things that he was building, or fixing, or whatever. It was perfect. My bench was just like his. Except he had chisels and drills and things that would cut well. I didn't know what I wanted to build or create, but I wanted those tools. Not tools like them. I wanted those tools.

I hadn't thought about it in years.

The kids and I visited mom a few weeks ago. She told me it was time that I started taking the things I wanted from the garage. I'd been avoiding it, I guess. It's been 8 years, and it's not like I don't have a house and a garage of my own. And the list of projects I could use them on goes on and on and on for days.

*If I take the tools, he won't be there anymore.*

I didn't say it out loud, I just thought it. How silly. Of course he's not there. You know that. But...

There's too much for one trip. I have to come back with a truck. I can set it up in the garage. The bench, the racks of chisels and files, saws and hammers.

And a smaller workbench, just to the left.
