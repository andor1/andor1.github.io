## In the beginning

Back in the day's of APRANET...

I'm a bit of an idealist. I don't think that's going to change, and I'll be damned if I let it now.

I remember the first time I saw what the internet was, and what it could be. I had used the internet dozens of times before, through an acoustic coupler modem no less, but it hadn't really dawned on me what the internet itself was until years later when I was in a chat room on AOL and someone directed me to a website that AOL's built in browser wouldn't render properly.

Being rather naive, I asked some questions and was basically told that I was A) a noob, B) blinded by the AOL service, and C) immediately assisted by the other, very kind chat room peeps. Outside the walled garden that my dial-up service provided was a whole world of (... ok. Literally the entire connected world.) people and computers and information, all talking to one another.

The FCC and Big Telco control all, and control prices to limit access.
