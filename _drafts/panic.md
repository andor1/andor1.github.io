So, yesterday I had a wakeup call.

While I was at work, I started feeling anxious. My breathing changed. My palms got sweaty. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack.

I've had this feeling a long time ago. I learned how to deal with these, or at least I felt like I had. *It's just a panic attack. I know how to deal with this* I left for my lunch break. I got home and it escalated quickly.
