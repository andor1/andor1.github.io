Here's the thing about a panic attack that I don't think most people understand. Even if you've had a panic attack before, and you've learned some ways to handle them, **there is a point of no return where everything spirals and you just have to go along for the ride.** You don't have a choice.

So, not long ago, I had a wakeup call.

While I was at work, I started feeling anxious. My breathing got short, as if my chest was suddenly too small for my lungs and heart. My palms got sweaty. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack.

I've had this feeling a long time ago. I learned how to deal with these, or at least I felt like I had.

*It's just a panic attack. I know how to deal with this.*

I left for my lunch break. I got home and it escalated quickly.

I thought I was going to die, right on the ground, in front of my 4 year old daughter. I've never been so scared in my life, more for her sake than my own. I fear dying like that, but the idea that she'd have to witness that at such a young age is pure terror. Oddly, this is somewhat reassuring to me now.

As I remember it, Sarah dropped Vivian off. I took her inside to get a snack. And I was going to go with her to the doctor. I didn't have an appointment, I was just going to go. Just the thought of being at the doctor's office was helping, reassuring... I felt like I was starting to regain some control.

We made it as far as the steps going to the car. All the muscles in my chest clenched up and I couldn't breathe. I collapsed to the ground at gripped my chest. Vivian looked at me and said something, I don't know what. Probably she was asking if I was ok. I called 911 and told them I was having a heart attack. Then I called Sarah. They're going to put me in a hospital bed. I'm going to have tubes and wires sticking out of me. I'll not be able to leave without help. I don't want this. Either make me better or make me dead. No hospital bed. No machines and beeping and bags with fluids and windows that look into the neighboring building.
